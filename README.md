# Handyman

Do you fancy solid code, readable code and code quality you can be proud of?
Handyman brings a toolbox full of tricks, gadgets, and helpers to achieve the best code quality you can get. Without effort.

It helps you create repeated files, add CLI and CI tool that work for you.

*Note: I use this tool mainly for myself with hardcoded opinionated defaults, but feel free to use it too and adjust result to your needs.*
